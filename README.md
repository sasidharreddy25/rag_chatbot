Stepup your openai keys in config.py

Then open testing.ipynb and install all requirements. Just run all the cells one by one. Enter all the queries you want to ask in the queries list.

### Improve Accuracy
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting precise prompts and employing techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReACT, among others.
- **Chunking**: Utilizing advanced chunking strategies like semantic chunking, agentic chunking, and markdown chunking etc.
- **Retrival**: Employing a combination of dense retrievers and cross-encoder-based retrievers for re-ranking, such as ColBERT and similar methods.

### Code Modular
Following the S.O.L.I.D Principles more efficiently:
- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- **O** - Open/Closed Principle
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

Doing better error handling and logging in the code.

Doing better documentation of the code.
